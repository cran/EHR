Description: Process and analyze Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The 'EHR'
    package provides modules to perform diverse medication-related studies using
    data from EHR databases. Especially, the package includes modules to perform
    pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses using EHRs, as outlined in
    Choi, Beck, McNeer, Weeks, Williams, James, Niu, Abou-Khalil, Birdwell, Roden, 
    Stein, Bejan, Denny, and Van Driest (2020) <doi:10.1002/cpt.1787>. Additional
    modules will be added in future. In addition, this package provides various
    functions useful to perform Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) to explore
    associations between drug exposure and phenotypes obtained from EHR data, as
    outlined in Choi, Carroll, Beck, Mosley, Roden, Denny, and Van Driest (2018) 
    <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty306>.
